# Skin Lesion Classification using ResNet50 (HAM10000)

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc Computer Science
final year dissertation submitted to the University of Greenwich.

## 📌 Project Overview
Skin cancer diagnosis is a critical medical challenge. This project
implements a **transfer learning–based ResNet50 model** for
multi-class classification of dermatoscopic images from the HAM10000 dataset.

- Framework: PyTorch
- Architecture: ResNet50 (ImageNet pretrained)
- Classes: 7 skin lesion categories
- Test Accuracy: 84.52%

⚠️ This project is **for academic research only** and not for clinical use.
